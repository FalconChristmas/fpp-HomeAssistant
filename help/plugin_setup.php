The Home Assistant Plugin provides integration between FPP and Home Assistant via HA's MQTT Auto Discovery.  FPP Overlay Models can be auto discovered as RGB Light devices in Home Assistant.  FPP GPIO can be used as HA binary sensors for input and HA switches for output.  All FPP <-> Home Assistant integrations are one-way, if an Overlay Model is updated from within FPP directly, those changes will not be reflected in Home Assistant.
