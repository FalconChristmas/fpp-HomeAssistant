The Home Assistant Plugin provides integration between FPP and Home Assistant via HA's MQTT Auto Discovery.  FPP Overlay Models can be auto discovered as RGB Light devices in Home Assistant.  FPP GPIO can be used as HA binary sensors for input and HA switches for output.  All FPP <-> Home Assistant integrations are one-way, if an Overlay Model is updated from within FPP directly, those changes will not be reflected in Home Assistant.  To use WLED overlay model effects as HA Light Effects, create a FPP Command for each effect you want to configure and provide the name that will be displayed in the HA light UI.
